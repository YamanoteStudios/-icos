Message from CEO

"
An influencer -- whether YouTuber, blogger, or Instagrammer -- is anyone who has a strong influence and voice on social media. I have been promoting influencer marketing since around 2013, longer than anyone in Japan, and have been acting as a leading influencer in Japan to expand the presence and value of influencers.

Over the past four years we have accumulated marketing skills using influencers and social media, namely, the ability to attract customers and selling power.

In addition, we are currently working on our ability to create better products.

I am the only Japanese entrepreneur to be acknowledged by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is the same age as me.

By developing and realizing influencer services using blockchain technology from sharing economies, starting with Japanese influencers, we can build a platform where influencers from around the world will gather.

We are a small but dedicated Japanese team that aims to leap forward and achieve dramatic results on the world stage.

Knowledge, academic background, personal connections -- none of that matters.

With just an internet connection, a smartphone, and social media, even an unknown individual can make his or her dreams come true.

Through PATRON, we want nothing more than to deliver love, courage, and inspiration to children around the world.
