 ADAMANT is an anonymous messenger encrypted with Blockchain. For individuals it is a Blockchain messenger available from any device with anonymity and data protection, usability and integrated payment system. It is Anonymous, instant messenger with secure peer-to-peer transactions. ADAMANT Business is a corporate system for data and message transfers with ability to digitally-sign documents and an integrated payment system that allows a company to reduce its internal transactional costs.

Technology:
ADAMANT is based on robust blockchain technology with its being code open and public. Using blockchain technology it has a great advantage of almost complete anonymity. A message history is therefore not connected to a specific person.

The System’s architecture ADAMANT is a fully decentralized system that is based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus (DPoS) algorithm. This choice was made in order to meet the following criteria: 
● DPoS allows for any transaction to be reliably confirmed within the 5 second interval. This time is critical for fast messaging and payment execution; 
● DPoS dramatically lowers the system maintenance cost — there is no need for vast computing powers and therefore — barbaric electricity waste, comparing to POW; 
● Fixed transaction fees;
● Dignified system scalability and reliability factors. 

ADAMANT system consists of two types of nodes: 
1. Full nodes that contain the entire blockchain database and which can participate in new blocks forging; 
2. And light-clients which run full data encryption on their side before further transferring to the blockchain.

However all blockchain operations are carried out by the full nodes, with which light-clients interconnect through the HTTPS protocol (End-to-End encryption), using a certain API to transfer all their data in JSON format.

A full node is using the following basis:
● OS Linux Server (Ubuntu). Installation on other platforms is also possible through the Docker application packages; 
● Node.JS Application Server; 
● PostgreSQL Server for storing the blockchain.

Light clients do make use of the following technologies: 
● Progressive Web App (PWA) — web application for the modern browsers;
● HTML5, JS, CSS, Vue — program languages and frameworks for web; 
● A full node utilization through the special API protocol.

All of the network nodes do use Peer-to-Peer scheme over the HTTPS protocol for their interconnection 

Features: 
Messages are stored in the blockchain
No access to the user’s address book
No access to the user’s location information
No user identifications – the app can be used completely anonymous
All messages are encrypted on the sender’s device and decrypted on the recipient side
The client app does never transfer a user’s Private Key
All work is done locally on the user’s device
No user Private Data is being transferred
Message histories is not stored on a device and are directly loaded from the blockchain
It is impossible to obtain the user’s IP-address
Program code and blockchain are openly sourced
Accounts cannot be closed, blocked or limited by anyone, including the developers.
