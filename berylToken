https://beryltoken.com/ 

NOTE: Beryl Coin ICO have just decided to discontinue the Beryl Crowdfund for the time being due to unfavourable market conditions. They promised to refund their backers of all their contributions/transactions in the next couple of days. 
This decision was published on their web page as at 27 March, 2018.

Notwithstanding, below are information previously on board about the ICO.

Beryl is a project for a new generation online dating app. We aim to solve many of the problems inherent to traditional dating apps by introducing Beryl ERC20 tokens. Beryls are a transferable in-app currency that unlocks premium features and acts as a gifting item.
Beryl token will be built as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and its purpose will be to be used to unlock certain features within the Beryl App.
On technological aspect, Beryl Coin believes Blockchain is a wonderful technology, destined to reshape the existing markets, business models and the way IT develops in the future. They would like to take advantage of the blockchain by integrating it into a basic, easy-tounderstand business model and idea such as online dating, something everyone has either experienced or at least know of.

Token 
Token Sale Details Tokens calculation The Token Sale campaign will be followed by a two-week audit period to review the contributions. Once the audit has successfully passed, we’ll issue the beryl tokens and send them to the ETH addresses provided by the Token Sale contributors. 
The total number of tokens will be calculated based on the following formula: Total number of beryl tokens to be issued = (Number of contributed BTC)*1150000 + (Number of contributed ETH)*70000 
Tokens distribution:
The total number of beryl tokens issued after the Token Sale is over will be split between three main groups: 
● Contributors – 85 %
● Founders – 14 % 
● Advisors – 1%
