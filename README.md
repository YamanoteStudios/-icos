# -icos
A repository for all repos

Pick an ICO from here and do some research on it. Look at several factors. 
- ICO date start/end
- Technology description (main points)
- Key features
- Team (include your points, look at each member's social media account)
- Money raised and CAP
- Accepted currencies (BTC/ETH?)
- Is ICO pre-mined?
- Road Map
- Exchanges that it might want to register on
- Is it open source? (you don't have to look at repos if you're not technical, just let us know if it's available)
- Backing? Who's on board? VC's/Angel Investors?
- How much funding do they need?
- How much of this funding will go to R&D and Team members?
- YouTube channel? (yes or no)
- Twitter channel? (yes or no)
- Telegram/Discord channel? (same as above)

Here is your first list https://hype.codes/top-ongoing-ico pick one ICO from that list and post that you are taking it on here so that others don't look at the same one. Look in #coins for example format. Good luck!
